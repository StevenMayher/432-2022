## When will the complete Quiz be available?

When [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) says it will - at 5 PM on 2022-04-14.

## What is available now?

- The [instructions for the Quiz](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/quiz/quiz2/432_quiz2_2022_instructions_only.pdf) are available now, in PDF. This file will disappear when the 31-page Main Document (which includes these Instructions but also the Questions) is posted.
- The five data sets Dr. Love has provided to you are available on our Shared Drive in the Quiz 2 Materials folder, [and are also found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/quiz/quiz2/data).
- The Google Form Answer Sheet you will use to submit your responses to the Quiz is not yet available.

## What does the Quiz cover?

The Quiz definitely includes materials from 432 classes **1-22**, plus all of *The Signal and the Noise* and all of Jeff Leek's *How To Be a Modern Scientist*. The Quiz does not include any of the new material from Classes 23 or 24, but may include things from Class 25. Dr. Love will let you know.

## Deadline

The Quiz is due when [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) says it is, at 9 AM on Tuesday 2022-04-19. Note this is a change (pushing the deadline back 12 hours) from what was originally posted.
