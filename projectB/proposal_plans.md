Status | **Accepted.** Excellent start. Cut down the sample size, as indicated. How will you assess the number of times a song had "previously" been on the Hot 100 if their first time on the data yields the maximum number of weeks?

Public | Yes
Model 1 | A model for a count outcome
Out 1 | My count outcome is the number of 20 points games by a player as a "traditional" measure of scoring output.  
RQ 1 | How does an NBA player's shooting rate and percentage from each area of the court predict the number of 20 point games in the 2021-2022 season?
Model 2 | A linear model fit using ordinary least squares
Out 2 | Offensive Win Share per 48 minutes is my linear model outcome. This is a catch-all measurement of offensive efficiency, normalized to the amount of time played.

Samples | 598 in Model 1, 196 in Model 2
Status | **Accepted.** Excellent start. Of course, you won't have the whole season's data yet, since the regular season isn't over until April 10. Do you propose to wait until then to finalize your data? Should you restrict Outcome 1 to players who played at least a certain number of minutes in the season or to those who started X games, or even to the players included in Outcome 2's model or something like that? Otherwise, won't you have a tremendous number of uninteresting zeros and ones among players who play infrequently?

Out 1 |  The recorded place of the lifter in the given division at the end of the meet. (1st place, 2nd place, and 3 or 3+ place) I grouped the 3 or 3+ place because observation for 3 is less than 30.

Samples | 394029 in Model 1, 321901 in Model 2
Status | **Accepted.** Excellent start. I cannot encourage you enough to sample complete cases for each of your models, and select a single sample of, say, 2000 observations and use that same sample for each question. Then split that sample into two groups and build the models with 1200 then test them on the other 800. For this project, that's fine.

Public | Yes
Model 1 | A model for a multi-categorical outcome
Out 1 |  Self-reported health rating (excellent, good, fair, or poor)
RQ 1 | Is the self-perception of one's health impacted by one's ability to do day-to-day tasks independently in Mexican-American elderly adults, after adjusting for age, marital status, income, and BMI? 
Model 2 | A logistic model fit using a generalized linear model and logit link

RQ 2 | Can the independence score of the respondent predict whether or not they have a diabetes diagnosis, after adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure, income, and BMI of the respondents? 
Samples | 1167 in model 1, 1162 in model 2.
Status | **Accepted.** Excellent start. It's better to give more detail on the source, as I have here. Diabetes status doesn't look like a particularly interesting outcome. I'd like it if you could find something better. Predicting the independence score seems like it might be a better choice to me, but it's your call.

Model 1 | A linear model fit using a Bayesian engine
Out 1 |  Ratio of visceral fat mass (gm) to android lean mass (gm) that I converted to a percentage value (Range: 0.87 % - 37.27 %)
RQ 1 | How reliably can age, sex, and basic laboratory measurements (glycated hemoglobin, LDL levels, hs-CRP) predict an individual's visceral fat mass to trunk lean mass ratio?
Model 2 | A model for a multi-categorical outcome
Out 2 | How many times have you lost 10 lbs or more because you were trying to lose weight? Categories are Never (0), Rarely (1-2), Occasionally (3-5), Often (6-10), and Always (11 or more). 
RQ 2 | How reliably can age, sex, basic labs (glycated hemoglobin, LDL levels, hs-CRP), and an individual's current visceral fat mass to trunk lean mass ratio predict how often an individual has lost 10 lbs or more when trying to lose weight when represented as an ordinal multi-categorical variable?
Samples | 2739 for Model 1, 2731 for Model 2
Status | **Accepted.** Excellent start. Why NHANES 2017-18 rather than 2019-20? I'd like to see more variation in the predictors. In particular, I'd like to see at least two predictors in each model that aren't part of the other model. Also, be sure that you have a reasonable number of observations in each of your outcome 2 categories. I'd want at least 270 in each, given a total sample of 2700.
