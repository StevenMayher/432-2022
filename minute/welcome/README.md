# Some Items from the "Welcome to 432" Survey (n = 45)

Thank you for completing the survey!

## On COVID and Zoom vs. In Person

- I am not going to do live Zoom once the semester is in-person. Our classroom just doesn't allow me to do that well, and I can't stomach doing it poorly. I understand that some people will not be able to attend in person at times, and that's just something we'll have to deal with.
- We will continue to video record the classes, and make those links available as soon as they are available on our Shared Google Drive, usually the same afternoon.
- We will live up to all requirements from the University and the School of Medicine about COVID requirements for in-class sessions, as they appear. I don't know meaningfully more than you do about when announcements of this sort will appear.

## How excited are you about taking this course?

- 1 = I have nightmares about this class.
- 6 = I can't wait to get started.
