# Lab 03 

This is the main page for Lab 03 for the 432 course in Spring 2022.

Deadlines for all Labs are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Instructions

The instructions for completing Lab 03 [are found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). Dr. Love revised these substantially on 2022-02-06. Make sure you have the latest version, with 10 questions, rather than 15.

## Data

The data set used in Lab 03 is the `hbp3456.csv` data, available now on our [course data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data). Lab 01 used the same data.

## Template

Please feel encouraged to use either the template we provided for Lab 01 or Lab 02, or another similar approach that you design.

## Questions?

If you have questions about Lab 03, please ask them [at TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/contact.html), or [via Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2022/pqhs432) using the **lab3** folder.

## Post-Deadline Materials

- The Lab 3 answer sketch will be found on our Shared Google Drive in the Lab 03 Materials. 
- Grades and (potentially) other materials should appear on 2022-02-22.
- Four nice examples of Essays responding to Question 10 from Lab 3 are now available [in our Shared Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1edHhTNRs-S4UEbNN-HWqOShxrb718zrTF44RY13_6dM/edit?usp=sharing).
