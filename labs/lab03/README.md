# Lab 03 

This is the main page for Lab 03 for the 432 course in Spring 2022.

Deadlines for all Labs are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Instructions

The instructions for completing Lab 03 [are found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). Dr. Love revised these substantially on 2022-02-06. Make sure you have the latest version, with 10 questions, rather than 15.

## Data

The data set used in Lab 03 is the `hbp3456.csv` data, available now on our [course data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data). Lab 01 used the same data.

## Template

Please feel encouraged to use either the template we provided for Lab 01 or Lab 02, or another similar approach that you design.
