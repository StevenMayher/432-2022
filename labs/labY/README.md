# Lab Y

This lab is optional, although we **strongly** recommend that you do it. 

## Part 1

Create a visualization (using R) of real data on a subject that is meaningful to you but that is not associated with either Project A or Project B, or with any of our Lab assignments. Then share it (the visualization (and the code you used to build it) with us. The visualization should be of a professional quality, include proper labels and a title, as well as a caption of no more than 50 words that highlights the key result. If you decide to create a new visualization based on a revision of someone else's work, you must share with us that original work, as well.

In Part 1, we will assess your work based on the quality of the visualization, its title and caption, in terms of being attractive, well-labeled and useful for representing the data, and how well it adheres to general principles for good visualizations we've seen in 431 and 432.

## Part 2

Write an essay (between 150 and 300 words) describing the background, creation and meaning of the visualization you created in Part 1, providing us with the context we need to understand why this is a meaningful, and perhaps important visualization.  In your short description, address each of the following issues.

- How does this visualization help its audience understand the world better? 
- Why is this particular visualization effective, and what are the design features it uses that we can learn from to help us make more effective visualizations?
- How is this visualization coded in R? What tools did you use, and why did you select them? 

## Deadline

This Lab is optional. To receive credit, you must complete it, submitting your R Markdown file and HTML result (along with your data so that we can run your code) to the Lab Y assignment in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) no later than **Monday 2022-05-02 at noon**. You can complete it at any time prior to that date. Late work will neither be accepted nor graded for Lab Y.

## Why do this?

Successful completion of Lab Y will improve your course grade by as many as 2 points, and will earn you some of Dr. Love's respect.
