# Lab X

This lab is optional, although we **very strongly** recommend that you do it. 

This Lab asks you to build a professional personal webpage for yourself. 

- Some of you have already done this in 431, or in some other context, in which case you'll choose option C below. 
- If you don't already have a website, then you'll choose either option A or B.

## Option A

If you did not build a personal website for yourself in 431, then use [these instructions from Keith McNulty to create and host a simple, clean personal website in a few minutes using R](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-and-host-your-personal-website-in-a-few-minutes-using-r-9c94e87e2942) then post a non-anonymous Note to the **labX** folder in Piazza celebrating your achivement and containing a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by.

## Option B

Alternatively, if you didn't build a personal website for yourself in 431, then use [the instructions from Lab X in 431 to build a website for yourself](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labX). Then post a non-anonymous Note to the **labX** folder in Piazza celebrating your achivement and containing a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by.

## Option C

If you already have a personal website that you built for 431 or for some other reason, then improve it in some way (add a blog post - anything) that clearly shows that you've improved the page in 2022. Then post a non-anonymous Note to the **labX** folder in Piazza celebrating your achivement, providing a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by, and adding a short description of what you have improved about your site in 2022.

## Deadline

This Lab is optional. To receive credit, you must complete it no later than Wednesday 2022-04-20 at noon. You can complete it at any time prior to that date. Late work will not be graded on Lab X, although we'd still be interested in seeing your site if you do this work later than the deadline.

## Why do this?

Completion of Lab X will improve your course grade at the end of the term to a meaningful degree, and will earn you some of Dr. Love's respect. Also, no one exists these days in a professional capacity without a website. If you're looking for Dr. Love to write a letter of recommendation for you in the fullness of time, he's going to want to see your website.
