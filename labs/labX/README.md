# Lab X

This lab is optional, although we **very strongly** recommend that you do it. It asks you to build a professional personal webpage for yourself. Some of you have already done this in 431, or in some other context, in which case you'll choose option C below. To complete the Lab, do any one of Options A, B and C specified below.

## Option A

If you didn't build a personal website for yourself in 431, then use [these instructions from Keith McNulty to create and host a simple, clean personal website in a few minutes using R](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-and-host-your-personal-website-in-a-few-minutes-using-r-9c94e87e2942) then post to the LabX folder in Piazza a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by.

## Option B

Alternatively, if you didn't build a personal website for yourself in 431, then use [the instructions from Lab X in 431 to build a website for yourself](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labX). Then post to the LabX folder in Piazza a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by.

## Option C

If you already have a personal website that you built for 431 or for some other reason, then improve it in some way (add a blog post - anything) that clearly shows that you've improved the page in 2022. Then post to the LabX folder in Piazza a link to your page for your fellow students to be inspired by along with a short note indicating what you improved in 2022.

## Deadline

This Lab is optional. To receive credit, we ask that you complete it no later than Wednesday 2022-04-20 at noon. You can complete it at any time prior to that date.

## Why do this?

Completion of Lab X will improve your course grade at the end of the term to a meaningful degree, and will earn you some of Dr. Love's respect. Also, no one exists these days in a professional capacity without a website. If you're looking for Dr. Love to write a letter of recommendation for you in the fullness of time, he's going to want to see your website.
