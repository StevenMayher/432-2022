# 432 Spring 2022 Lab Assignments

The deadlines for all Lab assignments are scheduled on Monday evenings at 9 PM, as indicated in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Late Labs Procedure

- Labs are due to Canvas by 9 PM Mondays, but we don't actually penalize any Lab that we receive by 10 PM.
- If for whatever reason you won't be able to submit the lab on time, please submit a short note to Canvas telling the TAs that you will submit the Lab by Wednesday at 9 PM, and then do that. Late submissions (unless excused by me) will lose 10 points (out of 100) if you both (a) submit such a note on time, and then (b) complete the work by Wednesday at 9 PM (48 hours late.) 
- If you don't submit a note or the Lab by the time we review the Labs (typically shortly after 10 PM Monday), then you will need to appeal by email to Dr. Love for us to grade your Lab, and if we do, it will receive a more substantial penalty.
- Remember that we will take the five best grades out of Labs 1-6 this semester (weighted equally) to form your Lab grade.

- Dr. Love reserves the right to add other optional Lab(s) as the term continues.

## Grading

- Lab Grades are posted as they are completed to the **432 Spring 2022 Grading Roster** Google Sheet on our Shared Drive. To identify your grades and read our comments on your Lab work, visit that Sheet and use the Lab Code Dr. Love emailed to you on 2022-01-31. 

## Regrade Requests

If you want Dr. Love to review the grading of any Lab because you believe an error has been made, please direct those concerns to Dr. Love through the Google Form at http://bit.ly/432-2022-lab-regrade-requests. See [Section 10.4 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html#appeal-policy-and-regrades) for more on this policy.

The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Loveâ€™s attention via email, and he will resolve it immediately.
