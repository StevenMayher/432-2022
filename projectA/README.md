# 432 Spring 2022 Project A Information

## Instructions for Project A

1. [Start here with General instructions (and advice for selecting data) for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/00_projectA_general.md). 
    - Project A includes two Tasks: a Proposal due in late January, followed by Analyses and Presentation work, completed in early March.
2. Next, visit the [Specific instructions for Task 1 (The Proposal)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/01_projectA_proposal.md).
    - This includes details on the required data cleaning and exploratory work, and is what you'll need to complete by the end of January.
3. Next, review the [R Markdown templates for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/templates) and select one to use for your work on Task 1 and (later) on Task 2.
    - Using one of these templates will yield results that are attractive, organized and easy for us to review. Please use them.
    - The templates (in .Rmd) and their HTML results are also posted on our Shared Google Drive in the Project A Materials folder.
4. As you're preparing your proposal, you should look at our [Draft Rubric for the Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/rubric_proposal_draft.md) to make sure you've done what we expect.
5. Finally, look at the [Specific instructions for Task 2 (Analyses and Presentation)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/02_projectA_analyses.md) so you'll know where you're heading.
    - This includes data analyses and presentation work, and is what you'll be working on in February.

All deadlines for projects are specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).
