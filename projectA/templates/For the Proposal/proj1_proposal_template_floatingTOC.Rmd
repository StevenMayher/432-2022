# Data Source

Details, details.

# The Subjects

# Loading and Tidying the Data

## Loading the Raw Data

Ingest your raw data here.

## Cleaning the Data

All cleaning and tidying goes here, leading to a single tibble in R. Be sure to explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. Do not show listings of the data as you clean it. 

## Another Cleaning the Data subheading.

I expect you'll use several subheadings here to help delineate tasks.

# The Tidy Tibble

## Listing the Tibble

Here, you will list the tibble, after all cleaning is complete. Just list the tibble.

## Size and Identifiers

Do what we asked you to do in the instructions.

## Saving the R data set

Now, save your tibble as an R data set (.Rds file, which you'll also provide to us.)

# The Code Book

See the instructions and be sure that your code book includes all necessary elements.

## Defining the Variables

Here, to help you get started, is the example from the instructions.

Variable | Role | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | ---- | -----------------
`subjectID` | identifier | - | character code for subjects
`sysbp` | outcome | quant | Most Recent Systolic Blood Pressure, in mm Hg
`statin` | input | 2-cat | Has a current statin prescription? (Yes or No)


## Numerical Description

Here's where you would run `describe` from `Hmisc`.

# Linear Regression Plans

## My Quantitative Outcome

Follow the instructions.

## My Planned Predictors (Linear Model)

Follow the instructions.

# Logistic Regression Plans

## My Binary Outcome

Follow the instructions.

## My Planned Predictors (Logistic Model)

Follow the instructions.

# Affirmation 

Be sure to include the text provided in the instructions.

Note that for Task 2 (Analyses and Presentation), we will add in sections called:

- Linear Regression Modeling
- Logistic Regression Modeling
- Discussion

before the Affirmation but otherwise leave the template alone.

# References

If you are including references, here's the place for them. You should likely be providing a reference for your data set, at least, including, if available, a hyperlink from which your data can be downloaded.

# Session Information

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```
