# On Project A Titles

As of 2022-02-02 at 11:45 AM, we have **30** project proposals, expecting an eventual total of 35.

In [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/01_projectA_proposal.md#title-and-authors), I wrote:

> Your project should have a meaningful title (not containing the words “432” or “Project” or “Proposal”) but rather something describing your actual data and plans.
> Please keep the title to no more than 80 characters, including spaces.

## Some Common Issues

1. Some projects are looking at two wildly different questions (one for linear regression and a very different one for logistic regression) which makes developing a title more difficult within these specifications. You may wish to focus on one or the other of your questions in developing your title.
2. Some people misspelled words in their titles. That certainly needs to be fixed.
3. There are some words I want you to avoid in your titles because they provide no useful information for the people in this class when reading them. They include: "Project", "Proposal", "Regression", "Analysis", "Correlation", "Study" because every single project is making use of the same sorts of tools, and because they don't really help us understand what you are doing. "Throat clearing" language like "An Analysis of" or "A Study of" or other things that add nothing to our understanding of what you're doing need to disappear.
4. It's more important, usually, to focus on the outcomes, rather than the predictors, in a title, if you can't tell us about both within the character limit. The source of the data is sometimes important, but usually not so critical in the title.
5. When in doubt, make sure that your title either poses a question your study will directly address, or makes it clear to the reader what that question is.

## A Few Examples

Some of you didn't keep your title to less than 80 characters, so you'll want to fix that in your revision. This includes the following titles:

- The Advent of OxyContin: Did OxyContin Exposure Increase the Likelihood of Opioid Addiction and Overdose in the 1990s?
    - Here, the author used both a title (within 80 characters) and a subtitle, but I'd recommend just using the subtitle and dropping the words "Exposure" and "the Likelihood of" in the title to get within the 80 character limit.
- Analysis of Hotel Booking Cancellations and Average Daily Rate Using Hotels’ Property Management System Databases
    - Avoid "Analysis of" - those are just throat-clearing words, and with only 80 characters, you need to make every one count. 
    - I'm not really getting a lot from the last six words here, and I don't know really what an "Average Daily Rate" is. 
- Maternal Health and Socioeconomic Factors and Their Imapct on Infant Mortality in Puerto Rican Populations
    - Be careful there - you've misspelled the word "Impact" 
- Assesment of Education Level and Work Hours and Relationship Between BMI and Hospitalization
    - Be careful there - you've misspelled the word "Assessment" and you probably need to find a better way to describe your key focus
- The Effect of Birthplace on BMI and The Correlation Between Cancer and Depression Diagnoses
    - I'm not a fan of using the words "Correlation" or "Association" in titles and I don't know what "Birthplace" means in this case
- Predicting Outcomes Drug Overdose Deaths and Childhood Poverty from County Health Rankings
    - I think you're missing a word or two, but a clear step in the right direction is to drop your first two words   
- Can a subject’s region of residence be used to predict weight and arthritis diagnosis?
    - This leaves me wondering what a "region of residence" might be, so you probably want to select a different way of expressing that part
- Black Representativeness of Postseconday Education Institutions in the United States
    - Be careful there - you've misspelled "Post-secondary" and you probably want to change to U.S., or drop the last four words entirely to get under the character limit.

## Some Other Cases Where I'd Like You To Change Your Title

- Predicting Weak Immune System and Incontience in older Americans using HRS 2018
    - You've misspelled "Incontinence" and I would drop "Predicting". Note that HRS = Health and Retirement Study
- Household Features that are Most Predictive of School Outcomes during Covid-19
    - Here, I would go with something like "Predicting School Outcomes during COVID-19" or be more specific about which outcomes.
- Models of Mental Health and Depression Using Lifestyle and Demographic Factors
    - The problem here is that "Lifestyle and Demographic Factors" is pretty vague, and I think of "Depression" as a part of "Mental Health" so I think I would drop the "Models of" and be more specific (if possible) about the predictors.
- Predict high cholesterol and high blood pressure level by multiple predictors.
    - I would change from "Predict" to "Exploring" and drop the "by multiple predictors". If you cannot specify the types of predictors, then just specify the outcomes. 
- Predictors of Depression and Fasting glucose, a NHANES based regression study
    - You certainly would want a colon, rather than a comma, between these phrases, but a simpler approach would be "Depression and Fasting Glucose in NHANES"
- Predicting the Heart Rate according to Sex associated with Other CVS Factors
    - Here, you should drop the word "the", which doesn't belong there, and you should probably not be using Sex as your single identified predictor. I don't know what you mean by "Other CVS Factors" (what do you mean by CVS - Cardio-Vascular System?) and you don't want to use the words "associated with". Also, "Other CVS Factors" implies that Sex is a CVS factor, which I don't think it is.
- Project A Proposal: Factors Affecting Heart Attack Risk and Mental Health
    - So, clearly, you need to drop the Project A Proposal piece. The rest is OK, but you could mention your data source, I guess, or be specific about the types of factors you are studying, and I would probably drop "Factors Affecting" here, too.
- A study about the association between the climbers and the highest peaks
    - So all of the throat clearing can disappear, leaving "Climbers and the Highest Peaks" but I don't understand what you're doing there. Looking at your project a bit, it's still unclear what some of your variables are, but I think a better title would be something like "Exploring Mountain Climbing Success"
- Modeling Associations among Spotify Audio Features of Popular Music
    - You might just drop the first three words and perhaps give some indication of the question you're trying to answer    
- Using Regression to Choose a Healthy Caffeinated Starbucks Drink
    -  Maybe instead of "Using Regression to" you could tell us what we might be looking for?
- Assessing Cognition and Quality of Life in an Ageing Population
    - Be careful there, you've misspelled "Aging"
- Weight analysis and COVID concerns within HRS respondants
    - Be careful there, you've misspelled "respondents" which you could probably drop. My bigger concern is that I don't know what you mean by "Weight analysis".
- How does the University Impact its Alumni’s Income
    - I assume you're talking about some characteristic of a university, but I think you need to be more specific about what that might be. 
- Relationship of obesity to common co-morbidities
    - I think you're missing an opportunity here to be more specific about what you're studying.

## A Few Titles I Was More Comfortable With

- Factors Associated with Gun Ownership and TV Consumption in the USA in 2021
- Exploring Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease and Depression in the South
- Comparing Household Conditions in School Districts in Ohio and Florida
- Predicting Wine Attributes from Typical Indicators of ‘Quality’
- COVID-19 and low-income job loss in southern states
- Factors Influencing Calories of Starbucks Beverages
- Factors Associated with a Successful SuperBowl Ad
- What Makes Coffee Great?
