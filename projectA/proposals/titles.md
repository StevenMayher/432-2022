# Some Thoughts from Dr. Love on Titling a Proposal

In [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/01_projectA_proposal.md#title-and-authors), I wrote:

> Your project should have a meaningful title (not containing the words “432” or “Project” or “Proposal”) but rather something describing your actual data and plans.
> Please keep the title to no more than 80 characters, including spaces.

Some of you didn't keep your title to less than 80 characters, so you'll want to fix that in your revision.
