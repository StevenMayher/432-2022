# Project Proposals Not Yet Accepted

We need to see a revision of the proposals listed below that addresses the changes we request, before we can accept the proposal and let you move forward. Please submit your revised proposal, including R Markdown, HTML, raw data, and Rds (cleaned data) to Canvas in the **Project A Proposal Revision** assignment. We will be happy to address any questions via TA office hours, or, failing that, through Piazza. New (lightly edited) proposal templates are [available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/templates/For%20the%20Proposal) and on our Shared Drive. These templates have changed only to adjust the instructions in Sections 9 and 11. Check over [the rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/rubric_proposal_draft.md), as well, if you have any questions about our evaluation points, or which section things should be found in.

## Proposals Where Dr. Love is Awaiting The First Revision, due Tuesday 2022-02-08 at 9 PM

Project | Investigator(s) | Comments To Address In Your Revision
:----: | :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------
32 | Cyrus Nosrati | Make sure you you delete all of Dr. Love's instructions from your final file. Section 2: saying "Each individual subject is meant to represent 65,000 people" is somewhat of an odd phrasing when describing each row - it makes sense when you're describing the rationale of the sampling method for the overall data, but not so much in this section. Each row isn't the average of 65,000 responses, right? Section 3: not sure that having Hmisc::describe twice in this work is needed, it may be more beneficial to have some smaller/more straight forward sanity checks throughout your data cleaning jsut so that it's clear that things are going as you anticipate. Section 6 &7: you don't actually ask a question, with a question mark. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).

## Revised Proposals Currently Under Review by Dr. Love

Dr. Love has received revisions on the proposals below, and is reviewing them.

Project | Investigator(s) | Comments To Address In Your Revision
:----: | :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------
18 | Kiran Desai and Grace Armstrong | **Revision Received. Dr. Love will review soon.** Minor comments: in section 2 you have some formatting mistakes (see "loading the data"); you should remove all of Dr. Love's instructions from your submission. I believe you mean "impact" in your title- some other spelling errors throughout. Please include your .RDS in submission. Section 1: small language clarification here: you state that your subjects are mothers of Puerto Ricans, does it makes more sense to say "Puerto Rican mothers" (and/or mothers of Puerto Rican descent - you mention there is data collection outside of PR); providing some additional context to the inclusion criteria would be beneficial for better understanding of this work. Section 3: you likely don't need both `age_at_birth` and `age_at_birth_years` in your final tibble- you don't include age_at_birth in your codebook. Also, it would be beneficial to state why you categorized the annual income levels as you did. Section 6: you should rephrase your research question so it better matches your planned analysis. Additionally, your birth_weight variable looks incredibly odd to me.  Your visualizations indicate that the majority of infants in this study were born at <500 grams (in 1994-95, no less!), which seems suspicious, at best. In your histogram there also appear to be several infants with a birthweight of 0 (or very close to 0)... that seems incorrect. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
19 | Cerag Oguztuzun and Abhishek Bhardwaj | **Revision Received. Dr. Love will review soon.** Minor comments: Please update to R version 4.1.2. Section 2: Please include a description of the subjects, i.e., the rows, rather than the variables for this section. Section 3: You should place all the cleaning and data management operations in Section 3.2. Also, for your categorical predictor, health_con, the level `poor` only has 29 observations. Section 4: For the listing, you must simply type in the name of your tibble, so that we can see that only ten rows print and can thus verify that you have a tibble. Section 5: Please add details about what levels (in the correct order) are included in each categorical variable in the codebook's description column. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
24 | Sarah Nock and Harrison Lindley | **Revision Received. Dr. Love will review soon.** Section 6: You need to more clearly specify the predictors that you will use in your linear regression model, and show us that they meet all necessary standards. Section 7: There is no clear question that we can hope to answer with your proposed logistic model. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
29 | Chris Jones | **Revision Received. Dr. Love will review soon.** Please include your raw data and your .Rds file. Section 1 and 2: I'm a little confused about the years you are talking about. 1930s/1940s and 1990s and then 2020 and 2021? This needs much greater explanation. You'll need to think about how you're going to handle missingness and provide us with those details. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).

## Accepted Proposals

While the proposals below need some adjustments, we accept them now and you do not need to submit a revision. Instead, you should make the changes noted below as part of the process of completing the final Project A. Augmented templates for the final project are now available on our Shared Drive and [also here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA/templates/For%20the%20Final%20Submission). The changes to these templates (as compared to the proposal template you have been working with) are the addition of new sections 8-10, and corrections to the instructions we provided in what are now sections 12 and 14.

Project | Investigator(s) | Comments To Address in Your Final Project Submission
:----: | :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Erika Hutt and Alan Kiang | Section 6: Your question also includes your binary outcome, so just edit this. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
2 | Alise Carlson | Minor comments: the websites in your first two references aren't linked correctly. You don't capitalize "united states" in section 2 and you probably should. Section 3: I am not seeing any confirmation that all categorical variables included in the tibble have at least 30 observations at each level/discussion of sanity checks- although this information is available later on - it would be nice to be told here, rather than looking for it. I'm also not certain why you would have/need two ID variables.  Section 5: It took me a while to fully understand what your variables were, with part of my confusion stemming from this table - you say for all of your `rep_race` categories that the possible values are 0-100, when I believe it would be -100 to 100.  More clearly stating what these variables are/how they are made would also be helpful. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
4 | Kristi Lin-Rahardja | Please include your .Rds and raw data in submission. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
5 | Jay Wei | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
6 | Gen Li and Jiayue Yang | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
7 | Raunak Nair and Sid Dugar | Section 4: Your data set `final_data` is not, in fact, a tibble. You know this because a tibble will only print the first ten rows. You need to affirmatively create this as a tibble, and not just as a data frame. Also, why would you call this final_data in your work, but call the Rds file `cleaned-data`? Please make the two names the same so as to avoid confusion. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
8 | Sneha Yamsani and Himani Sancheti | Section 4: Your data set `hrsdata` is not, in fact, a tibble. You know this because a tibble will only print the first ten rows. You need to affirmatively create this as a tibble, and not just as a data frame. General: The word data is plural thus "these" should be used rather than "this". Section 9: Is the dataset available online? If so, provide a link please. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
9 | Owen LaFramboise | Section 5: Add another column with the type, both outcome/predictor and numeric/categorical, to your table.
10 | Ben Kramer and Jacqueline Shaia | Please include your .Rds in submission. Section 6: Truncating a histogram and hiding the messages is not a good idea. You should at least include the full one since you'll have to manage the outliers you've hidden somehow. It's always a good idea to hard return after code chunks and before and after headers. This will help some odd formatting of the text you have.
11 | Paulameena Shultes | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
12 | Olivia Wilcox | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
13 | Alex Olejko | General comments: It would be better to build and clean a single tibble at the start and then filter/subset it differently for the two analyses. Two different datasets also affect your codebook; for example, the variable `color` in sample `wine1` only has one level, while the variable `variety` in sample `wine2` has ten levels. Section 4: Your listing should be limited to the first ten rows, and you can achieve it by converting your data into a tibble, which you have not done. What you have here are data frames, and not tibbles. Fix that. 
14 | Anushree Iyengar and Avantika Bhaduri | Please include your .Rds and raw data in your submission. Section 2: I'm not sure what "29 x = rows for county, state" means here. Check for typographical errors ("OUr")
15 | Ria Tilve | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
16 | Carly Rose and Diya Yang | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
17 | Michael Douglass | Section 1: it would be helpful if you would provide a little more context on the data to better understand the variables you go on to describe.
20 | Tyler Petrie | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
21 | Aaron Fletcher | In sections 6 and 7, you don't capitalize BMI, and more importantly, you don't actually ask a question. Be sure to present a clear question in each section that relates directly to your planned model for that analysis. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
22 | Audrey Zhu | Section 6 & 7: Please show that you have no more than 4 + (N - 100)/100 candidate inputs, where N is the number of rows in the tibble. Section 9: Provide a link to the dataset if it can be found online. If not, describe the source and your access to it explicitly. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
23 | Rock Lim | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
26 | Cong Fan | Section 3: there appears to be some unused code for loading data here. Also some confusing things happening in this cleaning section, that would be improved with explaining what you're doing step by step. You also state "I converted quantitative variables to numerical variables" - which doesn't make much sense. Section 4: you print your whole dataframe because you don't have a tibble, but rather just a data frame. We would recommend using "read_csv" rather than "read.csv" to read in the csv file as a tibble.  Otherwise, you have to affirmatively make your data frame into a tibble later in the code. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
27 | Jacob James Rich | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
28 | Katie Heinzinger | Section 1: recommend providing a little more descriptive information to better meet the section requirements. Section 7: you don't have a research question written out. What I can determine based on your information in this section is basically a prediction of whipped cream vs. no whipped cream. You say: "I am curious about what factors impact others’ decision to add whipped cream." From the limited information provided on these data, it appears that this is just the nutritional information on all the drinks at Starbucks - so it describes the quality of the drink rather than an individual's choice of adding whipped cream. In conclusion: this (not yet stated) question seems a bit odd with the narrative you are providing. 
30 | David Selvaraj | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
31 | Makaela Mews | Section 2: we'd like a little more detail. All counties in the US? Is that what you have? There are better ways to reorder the columns in section 3.2 - using the tidyverse and the select() function to specify the order you want from the beginning, and you should really be able to avoid using clean_names() twice. Your Section 3.3 heading is misspelled. You should use message = FALSE to avoid the message when you call favstats in section 3.3, or else include mosaic as a package you load at the start. In your table in section 5.1, I don't know what an fct code means. Also, [change the title](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/titles.md).
33 | Norman Luc | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
34 | Steven Mayher | Thanks for your successful revision. See my remaining comments on Canvas and keep them in mind as you prepare your final project.
