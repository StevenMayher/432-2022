## Today's Agenda

1. Announcements and other README materials.
2. Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Models: An Introduction (in the slides.)
3. We will spend some time helping people who are interested in finding a partner for Project B to do so.

## Announcements

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 18 due tomorrow (Wednesday 2022-03-23) at noon. **Details to come**.
2. Project A Feedback should be in your hands by class time. **Details to come.**
3. An Answer Sketch for Lab 4 **will be available by class time** on our Shared Drive.
4. Materials on time-to-event outcomes are found in Chapters 22-24 of our [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), and in several other places I mentioned [in the Class 17 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class17). Our department offers a full-semester course (PQHS 435) every spring in Survival Analysis.
5. Now would be a good time to update your versions of R, RStudio and [your R Packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/r_packages.html). 
    - Here are [the installation instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/software_install.html) from the start of the term.
    - R version 4.1.3 came out on 2022-03-10 and is now stable. I made the switch this morning and [encourage you to do so](http://cran.case.edu/).
    - The current version of RStudio Desktop is 2022.02.0-443, and I [upgraded to it today](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). You should, too.
    - Once you've loaded all of [our R Packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/r_packages.html) including countreg from RForge, don't forget to hit the Update button in the Packages window, and select and install all of the updates. 
    - My current session information is available [here](2022-03-22_sesh.md).

## What Else Should I Be Working On?

Nothing due this coming Monday except reading through Chapter 10 (on poker) of *The Signal and the Noise*, but two things are due the following week.

1. The [Project B Outline and Scheduling Form](https://bit.ly/432-2022-projectB-register) is available now, and due **Sunday 2022-04-03 at 9 PM**. See the instructions as well as [the Class 17 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class17) for details on what you need for the form, and other materials that can help as you get going.
2. [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/lab05) is due **Monday 2022-04-04 at 9 PM** (**the day after the Project B form**). You can do Lab 5 now. 
3. [Lab 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/lab06), due 2022-04-11, is the Lab which works with time-to-event data and is the final required Lab of the semester.
4. It's never a bad time to work on [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/labX) and [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/labY), as well.
