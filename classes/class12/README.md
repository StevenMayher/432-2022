## Today's Agenda

We'll clean up some loose ends related to linear and logistic regression today, in light of questions we've seen in the Labs and in the Minute Papers.

## Announcements

1. We'll continue talking about the `tidymodels` packages in Class 13, in particular describing some methods for doing logistic regression with those tools. I'll remind you that there's [a list in the Class 11 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class11#the-tidymodels-packages) of some useful things to read if you want to learn more about or go further with this approach. I will modify the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) to reflect this change by class time, or shortly thereafter.
2. Minute Paper after Class 11 feedback is on its way. The Course Grading Roster on our Shared Drive is up to date through this Minute Paper, and Lab 2. Lab 3 grades will appear early next week.

## About [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/quiz/quiz1) and Related Issues

1. Quiz 1 will be available to you by 5 PM today. [Go here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/quiz/quiz1) for everything you need. The Quiz is due Monday 2022-02-21 at 9 PM.
    - **PLEASE** read the Quiz 1 instructions carefully.
    - **PLEASE** submit your completed Google Form Answer Sheet by **9 PM Monday**. We won't grade late work on the Quiz, and we won't be sympathetic to pleas for extensions. You have four days to do the Quiz, and it should take you 4-6 hours.
    - If you have questions about the Quiz, you have only two ways to get an answer:
        - Post a private question on Piazza to the instructors, or email 431-help at case dot edu.
        - In either case, we will answer all questions received by 5 PM Monday. After that, you're basically on your own.
2. TA office hours **will be** held during the Quiz, for general questions and project questions, but if you have a specific question about the Quiz, you'll have to ask it in one of the two allowable ways mentioned above.
3. Piazza will close at 5 PM to everything but private questions to the instructors. It'll reopen after the Quiz deadline.

## One Last Thing

It's probably time to trot this out again, from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2048/)...
