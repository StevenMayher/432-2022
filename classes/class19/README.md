## Today's Agenda

Today we'll focus on two things:

1. survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models for time-to-event outcomes with censoring. 
2. robust linear models using Huber weights, or bisquare weights or quantile regression.

## Announcements

1. I gave everyone credit for the Minute Paper after Class 18. Due to a mistake on my end, I wasn't able to associate a name with most of the submissions, and I know some people submitted more than once. [Feedback is now available, here](https://bit.ly/432-2022-min-18-feedback).
2. I made some adjustments to the topics listed in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html). We're set through Class 23 at the moment, and I will post more specific information about Classes 24-26 as soon as I can.
3. Reminder: Now would be a good time to upgrade to [R version 4.1.3](https://cran.case.edu/), and to [RStudio version 2022.02.0-443](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) as well as [updating your packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/r_packages.html). See the [Class 18 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class18/README.md) for more details.
4. [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-conf-2022-is-open-for-registration/) is now open for registration. If you canâ€™t make it in person, virtual registration will be free and available closer to the date (2022-07-25 through 2022-07-28 in DC).
5. [Mapping and geographic data analysis with the simple features package in R](https://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2022/r-sf-mapping-geo-analysis.html) has a lot of nice material, prepared by P. Aldhous for the 2022 NICAR meeting.
6. [How to use Fonts and Icons in ggplot](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-03-04-fonts-and-icons/) with [the showtext package](https://github.com/yixuan/showtext), a blog post from Albert Rapp.
