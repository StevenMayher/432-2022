## Notes from Dr. Love on Effect Size and Interpreting Effect Sizes

I [built a description of effect sizes and how to discuss them](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class08/effects_note.pdf). 

- I strongly encourage you to read this document over the next couple of weeks. I think it will help you in several ways, most especially for Quiz 1, Lab 3, and Project A. 
- If you want to see the R Markdown file I used to generate this result, [here it is](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class08/effects_note.Rmd). The small data set I used to fix ideas is in [today's data folder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class08/data).
- For more on these sorts of handouts (popularized by Edward Tufte) see [RStudio's implementation](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/)

## One Last Thing

I'll link to an interesting presentation of some survey results on nearly 4000 science and engineering PhDs reported by Maggie Kuo and Jia You in *Science* for 2017-11-27, entitled [Explore the skills that can open career doors after your doctoral training](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/11/explore-skills-can-open-career-doors-after-your-doctoral-training). 

- A series of what are called [radar charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) (also known as spider charts or web charts) illustrate how well PhD training prepares you for a job.
- Separate charts describe technical skills, then interpersonal skills and then day-to-day skills.
- The three images I've clipped below describe results across all sectors, but in [the actual presentation](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/11/explore-skills-can-open-career-doors-after-your-doctoral-training), you can look at specific subgroups including several types of research positions, consulting, scientific writing, teaching, and others.
