## Our Starting Point for Today

- [An Introduction to Hierarchical Modeling (Visual Explanation)](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/) by [Michael Freeman](http://mfviz.com/)

## Other Resources for Hierarchical Data Mentioned in the Class 23 Slides

- [Generalized Linear Mixed Models FAQ](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html) by Ben Bolker and others. Other work by Ben Bolker includes...
    - [Some notes on (generalized) linear mixed models](https://bbolker.github.io/morelia_2018/notes/glmm.html)
    - [Some worked examples of these models](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/ecostats_chap.html)
- [The Introduction to Mixed Models from Environmental Computing](http://environmentalcomputing.net/mixed-models/) folks at the University of New South Wales, Australia.
- [Workshop on Linear mixed effects models from the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science](https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r_workshop6) developed by Catherine Baltazar, Dalal Hanna and Jacob Ziegler
- [A useful bibliography of mixed effect regression models](https://joelemartinez.com/2015/07/14/mixed-effect-models/) by Joel Eduardo Martinez
- [Using `sjPlot` in R to summarize Mixed Models in HTML tables](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_mixed.html) and [Using `sjPlot` to Plot Model Estimates](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/plot_model_estimates.html)
- [UCLA example using mixed effects logistic regression](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/mixed-effects-logistic-regression/)

## Some Machine Learning Sources from Frank Harrell (and friends)

I've been asked to talk a bit about machine learning, so I'll send you to my main sources.

- Frank Harrell's [Road Map for Choosing Between Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml/)
- Drew Levy on [Navigating Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml2/) is a great follow-up discussion of Frank's main post.
- Frank also has a video of a talk called [Musings on Statistical Models vs. Machine Learning in Health Research](https://www.fharrell.com/talk/mlhealth/) available.
- Another helpful video on some related issues from Frank is [Controversies in Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, and Validation](https://www.fharrell.com/talk/stratos19/).

## One Next-to-Last Thing

This is a **terrible** graph. Right?

## One Last Thing

The show "[A Gentlemen's Guide to Love and Murder](https://cvlt.org/events/gentlemans-guide/)" that I stepped into at the last minute last weekend went smoothly. So much so that I'm doing it for the rest of the run, which includes this Friday and Saturday night at 8 PM and Sunday afternoon at 2 PM. Tickets [are available here](https://cvlt.org/events/gentlemans-guide/).
