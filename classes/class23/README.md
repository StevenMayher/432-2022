## Announcements

1. To come.

## Our Starting Point for Today

- [An Introduction to Hierarchical Modeling (Visual Explanation)](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/) by [Michael Freeman](http://mfviz.com/)

## Other Resources for Hierarchical Data Mentioned in the Class 23 Slides

- [Generalized Linear Mixed Models FAQ](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html) by Ben Bolker and others. Other work by Ben Bolker includes...
    - [Some notes on (generalized) linear mixed models](https://bbolker.github.io/morelia_2018/notes/glmm.html)
    - [Some worked examples of these models](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/ecostats_chap.html)
- [The Introduction to Mixed Models from Environmental Computing](http://environmentalcomputing.net/mixed-models/) folks at the University of New South Wales, Australia.
- [Workshop on Linear mixed effects models from the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science](https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r_workshop6) developed by Catherine Baltazar, Dalal Hanna and Jacob Ziegler
- [A useful bibliography of mixed effect regression models](https://joelemartinez.com/2015/07/14/mixed-effect-models/) by Joel Eduardo Martinez
- [Using `sjPlot` in R to summarize Mixed Models in HTML tables](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_mixed.html) and [Using `sjPlot` to Plot Model Estimates](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/plot_model_estimates.html)
- [UCLA example using mixed effects logistic regression](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/mixed-effects-logistic-regression/)

## One Last Thing

I've been asked to talk a bit about machine learning, so I'll send you to my main sources.

- Frank Harrell's [Road Map for Choosing Between Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml/)
- Drew Levy on [Navigating Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning](https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml2/) is a great follow-up discussion of Frank's main post.
- Frank also has a video of a talk called [Musings on Statistical Models vs. Machine Learning in Health Research](https://www.fharrell.com/talk/mlhealth/) available.
- Another helpful video on some related issues from Frank is [Controversies in Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, and Validation](https://www.fharrell.com/talk/stratos19/).
