# Post-Class Materials/Notes for Students in 432

## Shutdown of this site is planned for 2022-06-01

The course website and all materials on it will go private and disappear on 2022-06-01 or shortly thereafter. This includes all materials on our Shared Drive and all of the recorded class sessions. Please grab anything you want to keep before then.

## Want to be a Teaching Assistant for 431 next Fall?

If you are interested in serving as a TA for 431, please consider getting involved, if that fits well with your plans next Fall. I always need help, and so do the incoming students! Information on applying for a TA position will be available in early May, and I will make sure all students who complete 432 receive it via email.

## A Few Resources for Further Learning

1. Frank Harrell's [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://fharrell.com/#teaching) course.
2. Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking 2022](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) and [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN)
3. The [Tidy Tuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and [David Robinson's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ub92c-5xFQ&list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8) remain a source of inspiration for me, at least.
4. Featured books at [the Bookdown homepage](https://bookdown.org/)
5. Tidymodels [learning examples](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/), and YouTube [videos from Julia Silge](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuliaSilge/featured), plus some more on [Machine Learning and tidymodels here](https://advanced-ds-in-r.netlify.app/posts/2021-03-16-ml-review/).
6. All of the books and other materials listed on [our References page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/references).
7. [Numlock](https://numlocknews.com) is a daily morning news brief about numbers in the news. I read it all the time: itâ€™s informative, entertaining, and I think you might enjoy it.
8. [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) is a weekly newsletter of useful/curious data sets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine. You can read the full archive and subscribe, too. It's great!
9. The [Storytelling with Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/podcast) podcast is definitely worth a listen.
10. [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is the book that teaches you how to do data science in R, and the [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) is also great, and has a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/R4DSOnlineLearningCommunity). If you want to work the problems in R for Data Science, you might be interested in this set of [solutions to those problems](https://github.com/jrnold/r4ds-exercise-solutions).
11. Marie Michenkova suggests the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/ as a nice place to find creative and effective data visualizations. She also likes https://www.reddit.com/r/DataArt/. (Thanks, Marie)
12. [Cleveland Clinic's Risk Calculator Library](https://riskcalc.org/) is a leader in developing clinical prediction models.
13. Developing a [data-driven CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv)? Nick Strayer's R package can help!
14. If you work with medical or public health researchers who would like to learn a bit more about biostatistics, consider referring them to [Biostats 4 You](https://biostats4you.umn.edu/) which provides some useful statistical resources for non-statisticians.
15. The best book to learn a lot about modern statistical learning remains James/Witten/Hastie/Tibshriani's [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
16. [A review of Bayesian perspectives on sample size derivation for confirmatory trials
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15715) as recommended by [Frank Harrell](https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1374103378654068745).
17. [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/index.html) can help you learn about R for applied epidemiology and public health.
18. Building something and want to cite the R packages involved? Check out the [grateful package](https://github.com/Pakillo/grateful) which makes this easier to do.
