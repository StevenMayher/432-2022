# Post-Class Materials/Notes for Students in 432

## Shutdown of this site is planned for 2022-06-01

The course website and all materials on it will go private and disappear on 2022-06-01 or shortly thereafter. This includes all materials on our Shared Drive and all of the recorded class sessions. Please grab anything you want to keep before then.

## Want to be a Teaching Assistant for 431 next Fall?

If you are interested in serving as a TA for 431, please consider getting involved, if that fits well with your plans next Fall. I always need help, and so do the incoming students! Information on applying for a TA position will be available in early May, and I will make sure all students who complete 432 receive it via email.
