# Post-Class Materials/Notes for Students in 432

## Shutdown of this site is planned for 2022-06-01

The course website and all materials on it will go private and disappear on 2022-06-01 or shortly thereafter. This includes all materials on our Shared Drive and all of the recorded class sessions. Please grab anything you want to keep before then.

## Want to be a Teaching Assistant for 431 next Fall?

If you are interested in serving as a TA for 431, please consider getting involved, if that fits well with your plans next Fall. I always need help, and so do the incoming students! Information on applying for a TA position will be available in early May, and I will make sure all students who complete 432 receive it via email.

## A Few Resources for Further Learning

1. Frank Harrell's [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://fharrell.com/#teaching) course. Frank also has several videos posted on [RMS Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoIB_Obddrk).

4. All books by Howard Wainer for popular audiences come with my strong recommendation, especially *Medical Illuminations*, *Graphic Discovery* and *Picturing the Uncertain World*. [The work of Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) is also definitely worth your time.
    - If you loved Speigelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*, I definitely recommend Wainer's *Truth or Truthiness: Distinguishing Fact from Fiction by Learning to Think Like a Data Scientist*, if you're looking for a book at a similar level.
5. [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets
](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) as compiled by Jeff Leek in response to [this twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/hmason/status/476905839035305984).

## A Few Important Issues in Statistics

1. [Large studies reduce random error, but not systematic error](https://twitter.com/aztezcan/status/1119233306300563460)
2. I can also recommend Brian Caffo's [Regression Models for Data Science in R](https://leanpub.com/regmods), and Roger Peng's [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://leanpub.com/exdata) and Rafael Irizarry's [Introduction to Data Science](https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook).
3. [ModernDive remains a terrific resource](https://moderndive.com/) for statistical inference via data science.
4. Interested in implementing machine learning ensemble strategies, like the SuperLearner? Check out [Alex Hayes' post using tidymodels to implement the SuperLearner](https://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/implementing-the-super-learner-with-tidymodels/).
5. Check out this article by Bates, Machler, Bolker and Walker on [Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models using lme4](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i01/0?utm_campaign=digest&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nuzzel)
6. You may be interested in [Maverick Lin's 10-page "cheat sheet" about data science](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/new-data-science-cheat-sheet), which is inspired by William Chen's [The Only Probability Cheatsheet You'll Ever Need](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/probability-cheat-sheet).
7. An extremely useful idea is that of splitting continuous predictors into thirds, rather than dichotomizing, [as described here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/thirds5.pdf). If you must categorize, think about the gains in efficiency this approach can provide.
8. Here's a nice video from David Spiegelhalter on "[What would Florence Nightingale make of big data](https://www.bbc.com/ideas/videos/what-would-florence-nightingale-make-of-big-data/p075lxkt?playlist=thinkers-from-the-past-on-the-world-today)?"
9. From Darren Dahly, [here is a simulation to demonstrate how you should decide which covariates to adjust for in the context of a randomized controlled trial.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1115902270888128514.html). There's an excellent follow-up series of posts, [from Frank Harrell and others at this link](https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1116311832652910597).
10. "[A Second Chance to Get Causal Inference Right: A Classification of Data Science Tasks](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578#.XNBr545JGUm)" from Miguel A. Hernán, John Hsu & Brian Healy in *Chance*. Find it at https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578
11. "[Calculating Observed Power is Like Believing in Fairy Tales](https://lesslikely.com/statistics/observed-power-magic/) at [LessLikely](https://lesslikely.com/)
    - "A discussion of events that transpired in 2018-19, where a group of surgical researchers decided to ignore much of the statistical literature and promote a highly misleading practice of calculating post-hoc power using the observed effect size."
    - Some related pieces at LessLikely include "[When Can We Say That Something Doesn't Work?](https://lesslikely.com/statistics/evidence-of-absence/)" and "[Misplaced Confidence in Observed Power](https://lesslikely.com/statistics/misplaced-power/)"
12. Carl Howe from RStudio posted (2020-04-22) on "[Getting to the Right Question](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/04/22/getting-to-the-right-question/)" - an always-critical part of data science work.
