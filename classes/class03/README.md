## Upcoming Deliverables

1. The [Minute Paper after Class 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/minute) is due tomorrow (Wednesday 2022-01-19) at noon. Please visit https://bit.ly/432-2022-min-03 to complete the form.
2. [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md) is your first substantial assignment. It is due Monday 2022-01-24 at 9 PM.
3. By now, you should have ...
    - familiarized yourself with the [course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/), 
    - completed reading through the class [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/), which [in section 14](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/one-more-thing.html) should have motivated you to post something about your favorite TV show on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2022/pqhs432) before today's class (though please feel encouraged to do it anyway now if you haven't.)
    - [updated your R and R Studio and installed the necessary packages for 432](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/software_install.html) so you can do [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md).
    - completed reading Jeff Leek's [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) and you'll need to have done that to successfully complete [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md).

## Announcements

1. I wrote up some detailed summaries of comments and other interesting things I learned from reading your [Welcome to 432 Survey responses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/minute/welcome). Please take a look.
2. Here are the [TV series that students in 432 identified as favorites](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class03/tv.md) in response to [Syllabus section 14](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/one-more-thing.html).
3. TA office hours begin tomorrow (Wednesday 2022-01-19) at noon. The schedule and Zoom links are found in our Shared Google Drive (432 Spring 2022 Dr Love and Students) in the **Schedule and Zoom Links: TA office hours for 432 in Spring 2022** document. Remember that [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2022/pqhs432) remains open for your questions (and answers!) at all times.
4. It is my intention to post instructions for Labs 2-3 and Project A before our next class. That would cover our primary assignments through February.
5. If you're interested, DPhi has some (as I understand it) [free data science bootcamps](https://dphi.tech/bootcamps#upcoming) coming up in late January. They might be good, although I haven't taken any of them personally.

## A New (to us) R Package

[inspectdf](https://alastairrushworth.github.io/inspectdf/index.html) looks interesting to me. The package describes three aims:

- to speed up repetitive checking and exploratory tasks for data frames
- to make it easier to compare data frames for differences and inconsistencies
- to support quick visualisation of data frames
