If you haven't yet read this [Important Note from Dr. Love on Effect Size and Interpreting Effect Sizes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class08/effects_note.pdf) first mentioned [in Class 08](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class08#important-note-from-dr-love-on-effect-size-and-interpreting-effect-sizes), then I encourage you to do so.

On a related point, if you are interested, please take a look at [The Many Flavours of Missing Values](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/09/17/missing-flavour/) by Nicholas Tierney, to learn more about the different versions of `NA` in R, and how to use them.
