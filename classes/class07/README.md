## Announcements

1. Grades on [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/lab01) are now available through the 432 Spring 2022 Grading Roster on our Shared Drive. 
    - You should have received your **Lab Code** (which you'll need to identify your work in the Roster) from Dr. Love via email (subject was "Your Lab Code for 432") on Monday morning 2022-01-31. If you didn't, email Dr. Love immediately and he'll resend it.
    - **Regrade Requests**: If you want Dr. Love to review the grading of any Lab because you believe an error has been made in grading your work, please send those concerns through the Google Form at http://bit.ly/432-2022-lab-regrade-requests. See [Section 10.4 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html#appeal-policy-and-regrades) for more on this policy. The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Dr. Loveâ€™s attention via email, and he will resolve it immediately.
2. There is no Minute Paper this week. The next Minute Paper will be after Class 09.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Once we review your Project A proposal and post your feedback and initial grade on Canvas, you will have 48 hours to revise your work (assuming your grade on the proposal is less than the full 10 points - see [the proposal rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/rubric_proposal_draft.md) for details on grading.) We hope to have all initial proposals reviewed by the end of the day on Thursday.
2. [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/lab02) is due next Monday 2022-02-07 at 9 PM. You should already be able to complete all of the questions.
