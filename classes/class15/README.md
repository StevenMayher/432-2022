## Announcements

1. Please remember to submit Project A by 9 PM on Friday 2022-03-04. 
    - Incomplete work, or late work (arriving after 9:30 PM) will be massively penalized. Do not be late.
    - If you are in the midst of a crisis that will prevent you from submitting the work in a timely fashion, Dr. Love needs to know that **now**.
3. Remember that we do not have class next week, thanks to Spring Break. Dr. Love will be mostly away from email from March 5-10. Our next class will be Tuesday 2022-03-15.
4. It would be a great idea to work on Lab X and Lab Y (and catch up on reading *The Signal and the Noise*) over the break.
