## Announcements

1. Please remember to submit [Project A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA) by 9 PM on Friday 2022-03-04. 
    - Incomplete work, or late work (arriving after 9:30 PM) will be massively penalized. Do not be late.
    - If you are working with a partner, one of you should submit everything, and the other should submit a one-page note to Canvas stating who your partner is, and that your partner will submit the work by 9 PM Friday.
    - If you are in the midst of a crisis that will prevent you from submitting the work in a timely fashion, Dr. Love needs to know that **now**. Email him directly (and now), or talk to him right after class.
2. Remember that we do not have class next week, thanks to Spring Break. Our next class will be Tuesday 2022-03-15.
    - Dr. Love will be mostly away from email and not responding to Piazza from March 5-10. 
    - TA office hours are cancelled from March 5-11.
    - It would be a great idea to work on [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/labX) and [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/labY) (and catch up on reading *The Signal and the Noise* - you should have completed at least through Chapter 8) over the break.
    - If you need more work over the break, I'd focus on [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab04/lab04_instructions.md) which is due on 2022-03-21, and which you should be able to complete after today's class.
3. [Project B](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectB) instructions will be available by 9 PM Friday.
    - During the break, I recommend you read through the Project B instructions, and perhaps try to identify a partner if you want to work with one, but otherwise let that wait until we return on 2022-03-15. This will let me discuss the assignment with you in class 16. Also, the first deliverable with regard to Project B is brief and isn't due until 2022-03-28.
