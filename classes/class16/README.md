## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 16](https://bit.ly/432-2022-min-16). Please complete it by Noon tomorrow.
2. Thanks to those who completed [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/labX#some-completed-work-on-lab-x) over the break.
3. The next deliverable is [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs), due next Monday 2022-03-21 at 9 PM.
4. I have moved the deadline for the [Project B Outline and Scheduling Google Form](http://bit.ly/432-2022-projectB-register) to **Sunday** 2022-04-03 at 9 PM (day before [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs) is due) so you'll have (most of) an extra week to get that finished. 
    - The form will open for responses at http://bit.ly/432-2022-projectB-register on **Thursday** 2022-03-17.

## Agenda

1. We'll discuss how Project A went, and when you can expect to see our evaluations of your work.
2. We'll discuss the [Project B instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectB) and I'll talk about the changes I've made since we last met. On Thursday, I'll open the [Project B Outline and Scheduling Google Form](http://bit.ly/432-2022-projectB-register).
3. Today's slides show examples of using multinomial models to fit regressions to predict nominal multi-categorical outcomes.
4. If we have time, we'll look briefly at the discussion of [this op-ed piece by Aubrey Clayton in the New York Times](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class16/nyt_clayton_2022-03-01.pdf) on Piazza.
