## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 05 [is now available](https://bit.ly/432-2022-min-05-feedback). Thanks to you all for completing this.
2. A draft of the Lab 1 Answer Sketch is now available in our Shared Google Drive. Sorry for the delay. Grades should be available next Tuesday.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Project A proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA) is due Monday 2022-01-31 at 9 PM. That should certainly be your main focus for this course right now.
    - The main problem I've had so far is people trying to use hierarchical data.
    - You are welcome to create multi-categorical predictors from quantitative data, but not go in the other direction.
2. We hope you'll also read through Chapter 2 of *The Signal and the Noise*. It's about making political (and other types) of predictions, and explains what it means to be a fox rather than a hedgehog. We hope you enjoy it.
3. [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/labs/lab02) is due Monday 2022-02-07. You should be able to do all five questions after today's class.

## One Last Thing

[COVID Is Changing the Dynamics of Medical Research and Publishing](https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/96786) provides an interesting viewpoint, I thought.
