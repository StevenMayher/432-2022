## Today's Presentation

2. Then I'll share [a few interesting visualizations, and also discuss a few topics briefly](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class26/stuff.md) and leave you with some advice. 
3. I'll also point you to the [post-class README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/postclass) for things to do to maintain and enhance what you've learned in the course.

## Some Reminders about Project B, and the end of the semester

## A Few Last Things

1. Erika Hutt had her baby last Friday. Everyone is OK - last I heard.
2. Let me take one last opportunity to thank our Teaching Assistants, especially Wyatt, Stephanie and Shiying who are here with us today.
3. Yes, the [Mets](https://www.mlb.com/mets) are off to a fine start, with 9 wins in 13 games. This is a key to my daily mood, I'm afraid.
4. I have settled into using ROUTE or TENOR most of the time in doing [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Dordle](https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle). When doing longer Wordles ([Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/), [Octordle](https://octordle.com/), [Sedecordle](https://www.sedecordle.com/) and [Duotrigordle](https://duotrigordle.com/)) I use SPORE, GUILT and CANDY as my first three guesses, or sometimes modest variants, like PROSE or SPORT/GUILE. I also like [Squareword](https://squareword.org/), [Waffle](https://wafflegame.net/), and more recently, [Xordle](https://xordle.xyz/).
5. My family and I do the New York Times crossword together on Thursday-Sunday. I do them (usually alone) on Monday-Wednesday. Our current streak (begun on 2021-11-01) is 171, and our longest streak is 303, back in 2020-21. We've solved 1110 puzzles through Wednesday of this week. My personal fastest time for a Monday puzzle is 4:13, but our family did one in under four minutes earlier this month. Our average times by day of the week are:
