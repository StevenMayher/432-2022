## Some Miscellaneous Stuff

1. I have settled into using ROUTE or TENOR most of the time in doing [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Dordle](https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle). When doing longer Wordles ([Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/), [Octordle](https://octordle.com/), [Sedecordle](https://www.sedecordle.com/) and [Duotrigordle](https://duotrigordle.com/)) I use SPORE, GUILT and CANDY as my first three guesses, or sometimes modest variants, like PROSE or SPORT/GUILE. I also like [Squareword](https://squareword.org/), [Waffle](https://wafflegame.net/), and more recently, [Xordle](https://xordle.xyz/).
2. My family and I do the New York Times crossword together on Thursday-Sunday. I do them (usually alone) on Monday-Wednesday. Our current streak is 170, and our longest streak is 303, all since the pandemic. We've solved 1109 puzzles through Tuesday of this week. My personal fastest time for a Monday puzzle is 4:20, but our family did one in under four minutes earlier this year. Our average times by day of the week are:
