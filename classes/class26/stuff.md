## Minard's Map: A Graphical Memorial

Here are two reproductions of Charles Joseph Minard's map of Napoleon's disastrous losses suffered during the Russian campaign of 1812.

### A Large Version of the Original

### A More "Modern" Presentation

- For more on Minard and two other crucial diagrams (Florence Nightingale's Rose and WEB DuBois' charts of African-American life) I encourage you to read "[Florence Nightingale and Victorian data visualisation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class26/nightingale_significance.pdf)" by Alison Hedley in [Significance magazine](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17409713).

## On Building Maps

### A while back, I built an interactive map using `leaflet` for Better Health Partnership. A screenshot follows...

- If you want to learn how to build an interactive map using leaflet, I recommend [R Studio's leaflet page](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), as well as learning something about using mini-charts within a leaflet visualization from [this Github repository](https://github.com/rte-antares-rpackage/leaflet.minicharts).
- Here's [another great tutorial](https://github.com/momiji15/apptomap/tree/master/R%20Ready%20to%20Map) to help you learn how to write code to collect tweets using the `rtweet` package and to display tweets on a basic interactive map using Leaflet for R.

### A static map built using [the sociome package](https://github.com/NikKrieger/sociome) developed by Nik Krieger

- One thing I haven't yet done is use thematic maps, which [can produce some spectacular results](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap).
- Here's the [github repository for `ggmap`](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) which can be used to make some fantastic maps.

### Amazingly cool (and dangerous thing) - RAYSHADER!

If you want to produce 2D and 3D hillshaded maps of elevation matrices, you want [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/). In fact, rayshader can even be used to [create 3D plots out of ggplot2 objects](https://www.rayshader.com/#d-plotting-with-rayshader-and-ggplot2) with just a few lines of code.

## Visualization

1. Want to build your linear regression diagnostic plots using ggplot2? Take a look at [the `lindia` package](https://github.com/yeukyul/lindia).

2. [Plots within Plots with ggplot2 and ggmap](https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2019/02/24/plots-within-plots-with-ggplot2-and-ggmap/).
3. from Timo Grossenbacher, some [bivariate maps with ggplot2 and sf](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/)
4. The [colorblindr package](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) may be of interest to some of you. It lets you make a figure in ggplot2 and then look at it in various color-vision-deficiency simulations. Still doesn't cover everyone, but it might help a bit. It also provides an alternative to viridis that some people like. [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) can also help.

## [Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961)

This insightful article from Robert E. Kass, Brian S. Caffo, Marie Davidian, Xiao-Li Meng, Bin Yu, and Nancy Reid in 2016 in [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961) as part of their "Ten Simple Rules" series is very helpful. The Ten Rules are...

1. Statistical Methods Should Enable Data to Answer Scientific Questions
2. Signals Always Come with Noise
3. Plan Ahead, Really Ahead
4. Worry about Data Quality
5. Statistical Analysis Is More Than a Set of Computations
6. Keep it Simple
7. Provide Assessments of Variability
8. Check Your Assumptions
9. When Possible, Replicate!
10. Make Your Analysis Reproducible
