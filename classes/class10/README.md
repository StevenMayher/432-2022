## Announcements

1. If you haven't yet read this [Important Note from Dr. Love on Effect Size and Interpreting Effect Sizes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class09/effects_note.pdf) first mentioned [in Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class09#important-note-from-dr-love-on-effect-size-and-interpreting-effect-sizes), then I encourage you to do so.
2. This weekend would be a very good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/r_packages.html). In particular, there's a new version of `dplyr` (version 1.0.8) which substantially improves some common error messages.
3. Minute Paper Feedback [is now available](https://bit.ly/432-2022-min-09-feedback).
    - Someone mentioned in the Minute Paper that they were interviewing for a data science job. Here's a Twitter thread with some [good advice about applying for a data science job](https://twitter.com/DrJasonBrinkley/status/1448475546514513920).
4. Update on [Project A Proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposals/feedback1.md) and on Project A Working Day, which is 2022-02-24, as indicated on [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md) is due Monday 2022-02-14 at 9 PM. I fixed some typos thanks to a question on Piazza, last night. Get [the current version here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). 
    - You should be able to do questions 1-4 after today's class, and you should already be able to do questions 5-10.
2. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/quiz/quiz1) is coming, although I haven't finished writing it.
    - You'll have all Quiz materials by 5 PM Thursday 2022-02-17. The Quiz is due Monday 2022-02-21 at 9 PM.
    - For those of you who've never taken one of my Quizzes before or who are nervous, you may want to look at this [draft of the instructions for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/quiz/quiz1/draft_instructions_for_quiz1.pdf), which will eventually be superceded by the actual Quiz instructions when those become available.
    - In developing the Quiz, I am allowed to use materials from Classes 1-12, Chapters 1-14 of the Course Notes, all of Jeff Leek's *How to be a Modern Scientist*, Chapters 1-5 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* and major items from the READMEs, specifically the lists of imporant things you've learned from the [Minute Paper feedback](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/minute) and the note on [interpreting effect sizes from Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class09#important-note-from-dr-love-on-effect-size-and-interpreting-effect-sizes).

On a related point, if you are interested, please take a look at [The Many Flavours of Missing Values](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/09/17/missing-flavour/) by Nicholas Tierney, to learn more about the different versions of `NA` in R, and how to use them.
