## Announcements and More to come.

1. If you haven't yet read this [Important Note from Dr. Love on Effect Size and Interpreting Effect Sizes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class09/effects_note.pdf) first mentioned [in Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class09#important-note-from-dr-love-on-effect-size-and-interpreting-effect-sizes), then I encourage you to do so.
2. This weekend would be a very good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/r_packages.html). In particular, there's a new version of `dplyr` (version 1.0.8) which substantially improves some common error messages.
3. Minute Paper Feedback **should appear by class time**.
4. Update on Project A Proposals and Project A Working Day

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Lab 3 is due Monday at 9 PM. I fixed some typos thanks to a question on Piazza, last night. Get [the current version here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). You should be able to do questions 1-4 after today's class, and you should already be able to do questions 5-10.
2. Quiz 1 is coming.
    - For those of you who've never taken one of my Quizzes before or who are nervous, you may want to look at this [draft of the instructions for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/quiz/quiz1/draft_instructions_for_quiz1.pdf), which will eventually be superceded by the actual Quiz instructions when those become available.
    - In developing the Quiz, I can use materials from Classes 1-12, Chapters 1-14 of the Course Notes, all of Jeff Leek's *How to be a Modern Scientist*, Chapters 1-5 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* and major items from the READMEs, like the lists of imporant things you've learned from the [Minute Paper feedback](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/minute) and the note on [interpreting effect sizes from Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class09#important-note-from-dr-love-on-effect-size-and-interpreting-effect-sizes).

## One Last Thing

On a related point, if you are interested, please take a look at [The Many Flavours of Missing Values](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/09/17/missing-flavour/) by Nicholas Tierney, to learn more about the different versions of `NA` in R, and how to use them.
