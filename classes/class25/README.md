All of the information we'll provide will appear at the [Quiz 2 page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/quiz/quiz2) by 5 PM Thursday 2022-04-14. We remind you that Quiz 2 is due at 9 AM (9 in the **morning**) on Tuesday 2022-04-19.

## Some Reminders about Project B, and the end of the semester

Reminders [will be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectB/reminders.md). This now includes the information in the announcements above about Zoom links for presentations. The new information is summarized below.

1. Zoom information for all Project B presentations is on our Shared Drive in a Doc called **432 Project Presentation Zoom Information**. 
    - If you are presenting Project B via Zoom, please arrive at the Zoom call on time and ready to share your screen. You will be placed into a Waiting Room on Zoom until Dr. Love is ready for you. If you're working with a partner, one of you should share the screen for both parts of your presentation. 
    - **In person** Project B presentations will be in Dr. Love's office on the ground floor of the Wood building, in Wood WG82-J. Please make sure you know how to get to that room and arrive 5 minutes early. 
    - If on the day of your Project B presentation, you need to instead give your talk via Zoom instead of in person for whatever reason, you will find the Zoom information on our Shared Drive. Please let Dr. Love know via email as far as possible in advance of your presentation time if you need to switch to Zoom.
