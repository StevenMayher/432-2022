## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides: [PDF version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class04/432_2022_slides04.pdf), as well as [R Markdown code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/classes/class04/432_2022_slides04.Rmd).
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and archived on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). Links to all recordings are on our Shared Google Drive.

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md) is due Monday 2022-01-24 at 9 PM to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). I updated the [Lab 1 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md) to:
    - fix the links to the [R Markdown template](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_template.Rmd) which is also available (Rmd and HTML result) on our Shared Drive (Lab 1 subfolder)
    - make it explicit that you should **not** impute missing values in Question 1, and that we prefer that you assume MCAR and do a complete case analysis in Question 2.
2. You should have completed reading "How to be a Modern Scientist" by Jeff Leek already. This weekend, we would like you to read the Introduction and Chapter 1 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise*. 
    - The introduction is really important, and provides a useful framework for what Nate is trying to do in the book.
    - Chapter 1 is entitled "A Catastrophic Failure of Prediction", and focuses on describing the problems of prediction analysis in the financial crises of the early 2010s.
    - Nate is the editor-in-chief of [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), which is a website that I read almost every day.

## Announcements
