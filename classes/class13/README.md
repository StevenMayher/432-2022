    - Be sure to review the [Submission Requirements](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/02_projectA_analyses.md#submission-requirements) and some of what we'll be doing to [evaluate your final materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/02_projectA_analyses.md#evaluating-your-final-materials) before you submit your work.
    - You should be submitting (1) a single R Markdown file containing the 13 section headings [described here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/02_projectA_analyses.md#the-portfolio) that produces (2) a single HTML file containing all work on the portfolio, plus (3) your slides for your presentation and (4) your video recording (we prefer .mp4) and (5) your raw data and (6) your cleaned (.Rds) data.
    - Take the [Discussion section (section 10)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/projectA/02_projectA_analyses.md#section-10-the-discussion) as seriously as you take the new analytic sections 8 and 9.
