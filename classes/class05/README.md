## Announcements

1. [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/blob/main/labs/lab01/lab01_instructions.md) Answer Sketch will be available soon.
2. Use the [Project A instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/projectA) to help identify a data set for the Project and get it successfully pulled into R. You should have a data set in R before Class 6 this Thursday, so that you can complete your proposal on time (by 9 PM on Monday 2022-01-31.)
3. Unless something changes, we will return to in-person learning for 432 on Thursday 2022-01-27, for [Class 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022/tree/main/classes/class06).

## Late Labs Procedure

- Labs are due to Canvas by 9 PM Mondays, but we don't actually penalize any Lab that we receive by 10 PM.
- If for whatever reason you won't be able to submit the lab on time, please submit a short note to Canvas telling the TAs that you will submit the Lab by Wednesday at 9 PM, and then do that. Late submissions (unless excused by me) will lose 10 points (out of 100) if you both (a) submit such a note on time, and then (b) complete the work by Wednesday at 9 PM (48 hours late.) 
- If you don't submit a note or the Lab by the time we review the Labs (typically shortly after 10 PM Monday), then you will need to appeal by email to Dr. Love for us to grade your Lab, and if we do, it will receive a more substantial penalty.
- Remember that we will take the five best grades out of Labs 1-6 this semester to form your Lab grade.
