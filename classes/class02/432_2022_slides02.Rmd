## Today's Agenda

- Linear Regression with Categorical Predictors
- Building Two-Way ANOVA models with interaction
- Building Analysis of Covariance Models

We'll use some BRFSS/SMART data about Ohio residents to address the following questions.

1. What is the association of diabetes diagnosis and smoking status on BMI?
2. Does adjusting for subject's age affect our assessments?
3. How does the subject's level of physical activity fit into this?

**Chapter 2** of the Course Notes builds the BRFSS/SMART data.

## Setup 

```{r, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)  
options(width = 60)     ## for the slides

library(here)           ## project management
library(knitr)          ## mostly for kable
library(mosaic)         ## mostly for favstats
library(patchwork)      ## combine plots
library(janitor)        ## mostly for tabyl
library(naniar)         ## missing data tools
library(simputation)    ## for single imputation
library(broom)          ## for tidying model output
library(tidyverse)      ## as always (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)

theme_set(theme_bw())   ## my personal preference
```

- I used `message = FALSE` in the code chunk setup.

## Codebook of variables we'll select from `smart_ohio`

```{r, message = FALSE}
smart_ohio <- read_csv(here("data/smart_ohio.csv"))

dim(smart_ohio)
```

We'll sample 432 observations from `smart_ohio` on these six variables...

Variable | Type | Description
-------- | ----- | -------------
`SEQNO` | ID code | we'll represent as a character
`bmi` | Quantity | body-mass index (in kg/m^2^)
`smoker` | 4 levels | smoking status (we'll collapse to 3 levels) 
`dm_status` | 4 levels | diabetes status (we'll collapse to 2)
`activity` | 4 levels | physical activity level (we'll re-level)
`age_imp` | Quantity | age (imputed from groups, see Chapter 2)

## Create our working data set (`day2`)

```{r}
set.seed(43202)                                ## note 1

day2 <- smart_ohio %>%                         ## note 2
    select(SEQNO, bmi, smoker, dm_status, 
           activity, age_imp) %>%              ## note 3
    slice_sample(n = 432) %>%                  ## note 4
    type.convert(as.is = FALSE) %>%            ## note 5
    mutate(SEQNO = as.character(SEQNO))        ## note 6
```

1. set seed for random sampling
2. modify `smart_ohio` data and place in new `day2` tibble
3. select our six variables
4. take a random sample of 432 rows from the data
5. convert all character variables into factors
6. set ID code as a character variable

## The `day2` tibble, printed

```{r}
day2
```

## Initial Data Checking (Quantities)

```{r, message = FALSE}
favstats(~ bmi, data = day2) %>% kable(dig = 1)
```

```{r}
favstats(~ age_imp, data = day2) %>% kable(dig = 1)
```

1. Do the observed ranges of values look plausible in context?
2. Are there missing values we need to deal with?

## Checking the Categorical Data (`activity`)

```{r}
day2 %>% count(activity)
```

> - What does `<NA>` mean? What should we do with this variable?

> - Shortly, we'll **reorder** these levels in a more sensible way (suggestions?) and then we'll have to deal with the missing values, somehow.

## Checking the Categorical Data (`smoker`)

```{r}
day2 %>% count(smoker)
```

> - OK. Some missing values to deal with. What else might we do here?

> - Shortly, we'll **collapse** this from 4 to 3 levels (how?)

> - I think we'll go with Current, Former and Never

## Checking the Categorical Data (`dm_status`)

```{r}
day2 %>% count(dm_status)
```

> - Next Steps?

> - Shortly, we'll collapse this to two levels (how might we do that?) and then we'll deal with the missing information.

## Re-ordering and collapsing in `day2`

```{r}
day2 <- day2 %>%
    mutate(activity = 
               fct_relevel(activity, "Highly_Active", 
                           "Active", "Insufficiently_Active",
                           "Inactive")) %>%
    mutate(smoker = 
               fct_collapse(smoker, 
                    Current = c("Current_not_daily", 
                                "Current_daily"))) %>%
    mutate(dm_status = 
               fct_collapse(dm_status,
                            No = c("No-Diabetes", 
                                   "Pre-Diabetes",
                                   "Pregnancy-Induced"),
                            Yes = "Diabetes"))
```

## Sanity Checks

```{r}
day2 %>% tabyl(activity) %>% adorn_pct_formatting()
```

- Still need to deal with the missing values, but now the order makes sense.

## Sanity Checks

```{r}
day2 %>% tabyl(dm_status, smoker)
```

- OK, now we have two `dm_status` levels and three `smoker` levels, although we don't have a lot of currently smoking people with diabetes.
- Once we deal with the missing values, we should be all set.

## How many missing values in each variable?

```{r, fig.height = 4, warning = FALSE}
gg_miss_var(day2) +
    labs(title = "Missing values in day2 (n = 432)")
```

- I used `warning = FALSE` in the code chunk setup.

## Table of missing values in each variable?

We can also just get a count of missing values for each variable with `miss_var_summary()`, which is also part of `naniar`.

```{r}
miss_var_summary(day2)
```

## How many missing values per row (subject)?

```{r}
miss_case_table(day2)  ## also from naniar package
```

- How many observations would we lose in a complete case analysis?
- Can we make the necessary assumption for a complete case analysis?

## What do we lose in a complete case analysis?

```{r}
day2_cc <- day2 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(.))

dim(day2_cc)
```

This seems clean in some ways (and is the default approach in software), but actually it hides a very important assumption, that the data are **missing completely at random**.

```{r}
prop_miss_case(day2); prop_miss_case(day2_cc)
```


## Missing Data Mechanisms (Notes, Chapter 3)

- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
    - The probability of missing data is the same for every subject, so that throwing out cases with missing data does not bias inferences.

- Missing at Random (MAR)
    - Here, the probability that a variable is missing depends only on available information in your data (the other variables we have). If this is so, then **imputation** is the most appropriate option.

- Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
    - Whether data are missing is dependent on either unobserved predictors, or on the actual true (but unavailable) value of the observation itself or both. Even imputation cannot solve the problem.

What should we assume in our `day2` scenario?

## Formulating a single imputation plan 

```{r}
miss_var_summary(day2) %>% kable()
```

Today, we'll use a *naive* approach to generating a single imputation.

- Impute `dm_status` with a random draw from its distribution.
- Use CART to impute `smoker` and `activity` from `dm_status`.
- Impute quantities via robust linear models using the factors.

## Single imputation in `day2` to yield `day2_im`

```{r}
set.seed(432021)
day2_im <- day2 %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    impute_rhd(., dm_status ~ 1) %>%
    impute_cart(., smoker + activity ~ dm_status) %>%
    impute_rlm(., age_imp + bmi ~ 
                   dm_status + smoker + activity) %>%
    tibble()
```

- `impute_rhd` (random hot deck) for `dm_status`
- `impute_cart` (classification and regression trees) for other factors
- `impute_rlm` (robust linear model) for `age_imp` and `bmi`

```{r}
prop_miss_case(day2_im)
```

## Draw the outcome?

- We're interested in diabetes and smoking's association with BMI
    - What do the BMI data look like? (plots shown on next slide)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "navy", col = "white", 
                   binwidth = 2) +
    labs(title = "Histogram of BMI")

p2 <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(sample = bmi)) +
    geom_qq(col = "navy") + geom_qq_line(col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Normal Q-Q plot of BMI")

p1 + p2
```

## BMI data in `day2_im`

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
p1 <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "navy", col = "white", 
                   binwidth = 2) +
    labs(title = "Histogram of BMI")

p2 <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(sample = bmi)) +
    geom_qq(col = "navy") + geom_qq_line(col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Normal Q-Q plot of BMI")

p1 + p2
```

- These data are a little right-skewed. Transform?

## Consider a logarithmic transformation of BMI?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
p1a <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = log(bmi))) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "navy", col = "white", 
                   binwidth = 0.1) +
    labs(title = "Histogram of log(BMI)")

p2a <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(sample = log(bmi))) +
    geom_qq(col = "navy") + geom_qq_line(col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Normal Q-Q plot of log(BMI)")

p1a + p2a
```

## Compare log(BMI) by diabetes and by smoking

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
p1b <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = dm_status, y = log(bmi))) +
    geom_violin(col = "navy") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = "dodgerblue", notch = T) +
    labs(title = "log(BMI) by diabetes status")

p2b <- ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = smoker, y = log(bmi))) +
    geom_violin(col = "red") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = "tomato", notch = T) +
    labs(title = "log(BMI) by smoking status")

p1b + p2b
```

## log(BMI) by diabetes and smoking together

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(day2_im, aes(x = dm_status, y = log(bmi))) +
    geom_violin(col = "navy") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = "dodgerblue", notch = T) +
    labs(title = "log(BMI) by diabetes and smoking status") +
    facet_wrap(~ smoker, labeller = "label_both")
```

## Finding the Means of Each Group

We'll plot the mean of `log(bmi)` in six combinations:

- two levels of `dm_status` combined with
- three levels of `smoker`

```{r}
summaries_1 <- day2_im %>%
    group_by(dm_status, smoker) %>%
    summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(log(bmi)), 
              stdev = sd(log(bmi)))
```

We can suppress this message with `message = FALSE` in the code chunk label.

## Here are the means of log(BMI) in each group

```{r}
summaries_1 %>% kable(digits = 2)
```

- Can we plot this information?

## Plotting the Means (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean, 
                        col = smoker)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_line(aes(group = smoker)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Observed Means of log(BMI)",
         subtitle = "by Diabetes and Smoking Status")
```

## Plotting the Means (results)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean, 
                        col = smoker)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_line(aes(group = smoker)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Observed Means of log(BMI)",
         subtitle = "by Diabetes and Smoking Status")
```

## Adding in standard deviations (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.1)
ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean, 
                        col = smoker)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                      ymax = mean + stdev),
                      width = 0.1, position = pd) +
    geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
    geom_line(aes(group = smoker)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Means (+/- SD) of log(BMI)",
         subtitle = "by Diabetes and Smoking Status")

```

## Adding in standard deviations (code)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
pd <- position_dodge(0.1)
ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean, 
                        col = smoker)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                      ymax = mean + stdev),
                      width = 0.1, position = pd) +
    geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
    geom_line(aes(group = smoker)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Means (+/- SD) of log(BMI)",
         subtitle = "by Diabetes and Smoking Status")
```

## Review: One-Factor Analysis of Variance

```{r}
m1 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status, data = day2_im)

anova(m1)
```

## Tidied `m1` output

```{r}
tidy(m1, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
    select(term, estimate, 
           low90 = conf.low, high90 = conf.high, 
           se = std.error, t = statistic, p = p.value) %>%
    kable(digits = c(0,2,2,2,2,2,5))
```

## Revising the order?

```{r}
day2_im <- day2_im %>% 
    mutate(dm_status = fct_relevel(dm_status, "No", "Yes"))

m1 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status, data = day2_im)

tidy(m1, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
    select(term, estimate, 
           low90 = conf.low, high90 = conf.high, 
           se = std.error, t = statistic, p = p.value) %>%
    kable(digits = c(0,2,2,2,2,2,5))
```

## Glancing at `m1`

```{r}
glance(m1) %>%
    select(r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC) %>%
    kable(digits = c(3, 3, 2, 1, 1))
```

## Developing a Two-Factor Model

We want to describe the mean of log(BMI) as a function of **both**

- the two-level factor `dm_status`, and
- the three-level factor `smoker`

One decision is whether we'll consider an **interaction** term between these two factors.

- A model with the interaction will fit the data a bit better, by some measures.
- A model with the interaction is most appropriate if we believe the `dm_status` relationship with log(BMI) changes depending on the level of `smoker`.
    - or at least if we are unwilling to assume the `smoker` effect is the same regardless of `dm_status`

## What is an interaction term (a product term)?

When we build our two-way model with interaction, we'll include a product term

```{r}
m2 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status*smoker, data = day2_im)
```

as compared to a model without interaction, which we'd fit with:

```{r}
m2_no <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status + smoker, data = day2_im)
```

Our main tool in thinking about these will be a means plot.

## Two-Way ANOVA with Interaction

```{r}
m2 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status*smoker, data = day2_im)

anova(m2)
```


## Tidied `m2` coefficients

```{r}
tidy(m2, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
    select(term, estimate, 
           low90 = conf.low, high90 = conf.high, 
           se = std.error, p = p.value) %>%
    kable(digits = c(0,3,2,2,2,3))
```

## Interpreting `m2` (the interaction model)

`m2` estimates derived from the indicator (1/0) variables

```
log(BMI) = 3.298 + 0.139 (dm_status = Yes) 
        + 0.011 (smoker = Former) + 0.013 (smoker = Never) 
        - 0.060 (dm = Yes)(smoker = Former)
        - 0.036 (dm = Yes)(smoker = Never)
```

> - Estimated mean for a current smoker with no diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.298, so estimated BMI = exp(3.298) = 27.06
> - Estimated mean for a never smoker with no diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.298 + 0.013 = 3.311, so BMI = exp(3.311) = 27.41
> - Estimated mean for a never smoker with a diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.298 + 0.139 + 0.013 - 0.036 = 3.414; BMI = 30.39

## What if we assume there's no interaction?

```{r}
m2_no <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status + smoker, data = day2_im)

anova(m2_no)
```


## Tidied `m2_no` coefficients

```{r}
tidy(m2_no, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
    select(term, estimate, 
           low90 = conf.low, high90 = conf.high, 
           se = std.error, p = p.value) %>%
    kable(digits = c(0,3,2,2,2,3))
```

## Interpreting `m2_no` (no interaction model)

`m2` estimates derived from the indicator (1/0) variables

```
log(BMI) = 3.303 + 0.101 (dm_status = Yes) 
                 + 0.002 (smoker = Former) 
                 + 0.008 (smoker = Never) 
```

- Estimated mean for a current smoker with no diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.303, so estimated BMI = exp(3.303) = 27.19
- Estimated mean for a never smoker with no diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.303 + 0.008 = 3.311, so BMI = exp(3.311) = 27.41
- Estimated mean for a never smoker with a diabetes diagnosis?
    - log(BMI) = 3.303 + 0.008 + 0.101 = 3.412 so BMI = 30.33

## What did we see in the data?

Estimates of mean(log(BMI)) from the two models, vs. the actual data.

`dm_status` | `smoker` | n | actual | `m2` est. | `m2_no` est.
-------: | -----: | ---: | ----: | ----: | ----:
No | Current | 67 | 3.298 | 3.298 | 3.303
No | Never | 197 | 3.311 | 3.311 | 3.311
Yes | Never | 34 | 3.414 | 3.414 | 3.412
No | Former | 101 | 3.309 | 3.309 | 3.305
Yes | Current | 10 | 3.437 | 3.437 | 3.404
Yes | Former | 23 | 3.389 | 3.389 | 3.406

- The two-way ANOVA model with interaction simply reproduces the observed means.
- Not clear we want to assume the interaction effect is actually zero.

## Interaction Plot shows non-parallel lines?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
p1 <- ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = smoker, y = mean, 
                        col = dm_status)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_line(aes(group = dm_status)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Observed Means of log(BMI)")

p2 <- ggplot(summaries_1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean, 
                        col = smoker)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_line(aes(group = smoker)) +
    labs(y = "log(bmi)", 
         title = "Observed Means of log(BMI)")

p1 / p2 + plot_annotation(title = "Two versions of the Means Plot")
```

## How about % of variation explained measures?

```{r}
tidy(anova(m2)) %>% select(term, df, sumsq) %>% 
    kable(dig = c(0, 0, 4))
```

- $R^2$ associated with the interaction term?
    - SS(interaction) is 0.0214
    - SS(`m2`) = 0.5748 + 0.0051 + 0.0214 = 0.6013
    - Interaction accounts for 3.6% of the variation explained by `m2`
    - Interaction accounts for 0.0214 / (0.6013 + 16.3282) = 0.0013, or about 0.13% of the variation in log(BMI)

## Comparison of Fit across the models?

```{r}
comp_table <- bind_rows( glance(m2), glance(m2_no) ) %>%
    mutate(mod = c("m2", "m2_no"))

comp_table %>%
    select(mod, r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC) %>%
    kable(dig = c(0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1))
```

- Is there much to choose from in comparing the in-sample performance?

## How else can we assess the fit of these models?

We're not keen on making model decisions based on significance tests. Model selection doesn't actually work well, in practice.

```{r}
anova(m2, m2_no)
```

- We'd rather think about how the two models reflect the data we have *and* predict on new data.

## OK, what if we add age as a covariate?

ANCOVA model `m3` takes our model `m2` (with interaction) and adds in `age_imp` (centered by subtracting off its mean) as a predictor. 

```{r}
day2_im <- day2_im %>%
    mutate(age_c = age_imp - mean(age_imp))

day2_im %>% select(age_imp, age_c) %>% summary()
```

## OK, what if we add age as a covariate?

Here's an analysis of **covariance** model `m3` with a factor-factor interaction, plus a centered quantitative covariate.

```{r}
m3 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status * smoker + age_c,
         data = day2_im)
```

Does this change the nature of the relationship we see between `dm_status`, `smoker` and `bmi`?

## Model `m3` coefficients

```{r}
tidy(m3, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>% 
    select(term, estimate, low90 = conf.low, 
           high90 = conf.high) %>% kable(dig = 3)
```

## ANOVA results for `m2` and `m3`

```{r}
tidy(anova(m3)) %>% select(term, df, sumsq) %>% kable(dig = 3)
tidy(anova(m2)) %>% select(term, df, sumsq) %>% kable(dig = 3)
```

## Does `age_imp` improve quality of fit?

```{r}
comp_table <- bind_rows( glance(m2), glance(m3) ) %>%
    mutate(mod = c("m2", "m3"))

comp_table %>%
    select(mod, r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC) %>%
    kable(dig = c(0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1))
```

## How about if we add a third factor (`activity`)?

```{r}
m4 <- lm(log(bmi) ~ dm_status * smoker + age_c + activity, 
          data = day2_im)
tidy(anova(m4)) %>% select(term, df, sumsq) %>% 
    kable(dig = 3)
```
## Does `activity` improve quality of fit?

```{r}
comp_table <- bind_rows( glance(m1), glance(m2), glance(m3), 
                     glance(m4)) %>%
    mutate(mod = c("m1", "m2", "m3", "m4"))

comp_table %>%
    select(mod, r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC) %>%
    kable(dig = c(0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1))
```

## What's next?

- Is it feasible to look at the assumptions of these models?
- Could we consider additional interaction terms?
    - factor-factor interactions?
    - factor-covariate interactions?
- Interaction is just one type of non-linearity. Can we include other types?
- Should we think more about back-transformation in this setting?
- Could we split the sample and consider how well we'd predict in new data?
- Is `lm` the best way to fit regression models to a quantitative outcome like log(`bmi`)?

Can we build up our framework for developing regression models?
