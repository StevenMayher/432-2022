## Announcements

1. On our Shared Google Drive, you'll find a document called **Links to Video Recordings of 432 Classes - Spring 2022**. That's a good place to find links to each class' video recording and transcript (which you can download if you like.) 
    - I'll also try to keep these posted on Canvas through Echo 360, but I'm not 100% sure that's working properly at this point.
2. Our co-lead TA, Wyatt Bensken, is giving a Zoom seminar tomorrow (2022-01-14) from 9-10 AM as part of the Population Health Research Institute Seminar Series at MetroHealth, on "[Inconsistent Medicaid Coverage is Associated with Negative Health Events for People with Epilepsy](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/seminar-series)." Additional details, including the Zoom link, [are available here](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/seminar-series).
