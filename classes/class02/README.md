## Announcements

1. On our Shared Google Drive, you'll find a document called **Links to Video Recordings of 432 Classes - Spring 2022**. That's a good place to find links to each class' video recording and transcript (which you can download if you like.) 
    - I'll also try to keep these posted on Canvas through Echo 360, but I'm not 100% sure that's working properly at this point.
